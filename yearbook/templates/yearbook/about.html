            <h2 class="about-title">Why a yearbook? Why Autbase?</h2>
            <p class="about-text">"It's been a long day without you, my friend<br>
            And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again"</p>
            <p class="about-text">I still remember the first time I came to the CE department of AUT. I look back on those memories with fondness and a happy heart, as I know many of us do and will continue to do. This website exists for that very reason: to help us remember who we were when we first joined CE@AUT and to remind us of the growth and changes we've experienced, shaping us into the people we are now as we leave.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p class="desc-text left-aligned">If you are an AUT CE graduate (Class of '98), I invite you to create an account and reminisce with your classmates about the days we shared.</p> </li>
                <li> <p class="desc-text left-aligned">If you are a recent graduate from any other AUT department, email me, and I will create a space for your class on the website.</p> </li>
                <li> <p class="desc-text left-aligned">If you want to create a yearbook like this one for your own graduating class, you can access the source code on my GitHub repo.</p> </li>
                <li> <p class="desc-text left-aligned">If you enjoyed the site, I kindly ask you to give a star to the repo. It means a lot to me.</p> </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="about-text light-blue">Lastly, this yearbook was made and is now hosted on a server that I have rented with my own pocket money. If you liked the site and are in a position to help, please contact me. As of now, I am uncertain about the siteâ€™s future stability due to financial constraints.</p>
